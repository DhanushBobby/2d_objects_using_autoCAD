## Instructions

### Setting Up the Drawing

- Open AutoCAD and create a new 2D drawing.
- Set the units and drawing scale to ensure accurate dimensions.

### Drawing the Main Body

- Use the "Rectangle" or "Polyline" command to draw the rectangular or cuboid shape of the post box. Ensure that the proportions are accurate and match the real-world size.
- To create rounded edges, use the "Fillet" command to round the corners.

### Adding Details

- Draw the letter slot on the front face of the post box. It is typically a narrow, elongated rectangle or an arched shape.
- Create the collection door, usually located on the lower part of the post box. It's a rectangular shape with a handle or latch. Include hinges if necessary.
- Add any decorative elements or features to the post box, such as ornamental patterns or logos.

### Coloring

- Apply the red color to the appropriate areas since the post box is red. Use the "Hatch" command to fill in the box with a red pattern to represent the color.

### Labeling

- If necessary, add text labels to indicate the postal service or any other relevant information. Use the "Text" command for this purpose.

### Scaling

- Ensure that the dimensions are accurate by using the "Scale" command if needed.

### Layers

- Organize your drawing by using layers to separate different elements (e.g., outlines, text, hatches, etc.).

### Finishing Touches

- You can add a simple base or stand for the post box to give it a more realistic appearance.

### Final Check

- Double-check all dimensions, proportions, and details to ensure accuracy.

### Saving and Exporting

- Save your 2D post box drawing in a suitable file format, such as DWG or DXF, for further use in AutoCAD or for documentation.
